# ML labs from MIPT course

**basic_neural_network.ipynb and modules.ipynb** - the implementation of the layers of neural network, comparison of different activation functions, 
impact analysis of dropout and batch normalization and comparison between my implementation and PyTorch implementation

**overfitting.ipynb** - the task is to train a fully-connected network to classify Fashion-MNIST dataset and cause considerable overfitting by increasing the number of network parameters and/or layers. Then the goal is to cope with overfitting by using regularization techniques (Dropout/Batchnorm/...).

**poetry_generation.ipynb** - here I train RNN and LSTM on Shakespeare sonnets and compare these two models. Also I analyse the impact of temperature parameter on generated sonnets.

**ml_pipeline.ipynb** - this lab is devoted to machine learning pipeline: data preprocessing, model training and evaluation.

**SVM.ipynb** - the task is to classify points on the plane using SVM with different kernels and compare results with other methods (such as logistic regression, random forest, gradient boosting)
